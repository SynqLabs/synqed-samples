# Synqed API - Documentation & Examples

**AI agents can finally collaborate and interact with each other.**

This repository contains comprehensive documentation, examples, and tutorials for the Synqed API—enabling  AI-to-AI interaction where agents can talk, coordinate, delegate work, and solve problems together.

## What is Synqed?

Synqed enables direct AI-to-AI interaction for building real multi-agent systems. Agents can:

- **Collaborate** - Work together on complex tasks
- **Communicate** - Exchange messages and context

All seamless. All autonomous.
